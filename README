Some simple ctypes python bindings for librtlsdr

First, get and install librtlsdr from http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr

This does nothing but wrap librtlsdr

librtlsdr.so should be in your library path. It's a good idea if you
make sure that the rtlsdr binary that comes with it works before you
try this.

I haven't tested this with windows. Theoretically it should work with
librtlsdr compiled as a DLL
